## üöÄ Why Research Assistant?

- **Multi-Agent Intelligence:**  
  Orchestrates a suite of specialized agents‚Äîeach an expert in search, deep analysis, synthesis, and reflection‚Äîworking in concert to tackle complex research tasks.
- **Seamless Cooperation & State Management:**  
  Features a persistent, thread-based state system that enables context-rich, multi-turn conversations and uninterrupted analytical workflows.
- **Live & Deep Analysis:**  
  Effortlessly switches between broad web-scale search and in-depth, document-level analysis, adapting to your research needs in real time.
- **API-First, Developer-Friendly:**  
  Built on FastAPI, with clear endpoints and modern standards for easy integration into your own tools, dashboards, or pipelines.
- **Extensible & Production-Ready:**  
  Modular design, Docker support, and robust checkpointing make it suitable for both rapid prototyping and enterprise deployment.

## üß† Core Features

- **Multi-Agent System:**  
  - **Search Agent:** Retrieves and synthesizes information from the web and vector stores.
  - **Deep Analysis Agent:** Performs comprehensive, document-level analysis of academic papers.
  - **Improver/Reflector Agent:** Iteratively refines and critiques outputs for clarity and depth.
  - **Main Orchestrator:** Routes tasks and manages agent cooperation for optimal results.

- **Persistent State & Threading:**  
  - Every research session is tracked via a unique `thread_id`, ensuring continuity and context retention across multiple interactions.

- **Rich API Endpoints:**  
  - **/run:** Launch a new research session or continue an existing one.
  - **/state/{thread_id}:** Retrieve the current state of any session.
  - **/health:** Instantly check system status.
